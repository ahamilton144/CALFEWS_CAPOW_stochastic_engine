## Welcome!

This is a clone of the California and West Coast Power System model ([CAPOW](https://github.com/romulus97/CAPOW_PY36)). This repository is a trimmed down version, isolating the stochastic engine, so that it can be integrated into the California Food-Energy-Water System model ([CALFEWS](https://github.com/hbz5000/CALFEWS)).

**Still in development**
